# Attention-GRU_text_classification

Codes in this repository is an implement of HAN model, which is based on GRU network and attention mechanism, and the original paper "**Implementation of Hierarchical Attention Networks for Document Classification**" (Yang et al., 2017) is [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~diyiy/docs/naacl16.pdf).

I use Amazon Review datasets to do this implement.

And my codes is referring to [Irvinglove's codes](https://github.com/Irvinglove/HAN-text-classification).

Thank to all.
