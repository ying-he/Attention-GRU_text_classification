# Attention-GRU_text_classification

Codes in this repository is an implement of HAN model, which is based on GRU network and attention mechanism, and the original paper is "**[Implementation of Hierarchical Attention Networks for Document Classification](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~diyiy/docs/naacl16.pdf)**" (Yang et al., 2017).

I use Amazon Review datasets to do this implement.

**Version requirements**:

- Python 3.6

- Tensorflow 1.12+

- numpy

- gensim (for training word2vec model and obtaining word embeddings)


And my codes are referring to [Irvinglove's codes](https://github.com/Irvinglove/HAN-text-classification).

Thank to all.
